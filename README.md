# darts-calculator

A react-native front end mobile application that gives the user the ability to score their darts games at home with ease. The user has the option of a single player scorer, or two player scorer, if they wish.

The app also has the functionality to keep track of statistics such as 3-Dart Average, Highest Checkout and Total 180s to enhance the user experience.

I have completed the MVP for this project, but have ideas to add more features to this in the future including:

- Add up to a 6 player scoring game
- Pop ups for 180 hit and a win of a leg (just for multiplayer)
- More stats available to the user including a checkout success percentage, an average for every first, second and third darts thrown in every visit, and favourite double
- Improve the general design and usuability of the app

### How to run the app locally

Firstly, clone the repository and change to the correct directory:

- `git clone https://github.com/benmccarrick/darts-calculator.git`

Next, install dependencies with the below command:

To open the application locally, run the following:

Scan the QR code to run the app on Expo Go on your mobile (the Expo Go app with need to be installed onto your mobile beforehand).
